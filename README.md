Project made for LP2 class using .NET Core (*C#*). It replicates _Breakout_ 
from the Atari 2600.

## Our solution

### Architecture

The program was made with Windows Forms for a more appealing way to show data
and interact with it. It was made using the most recent topics taught in LP2,
such as Patterns, I/O, Lambda Expressions and *LINQ*, as well as all the
previous things we learned so far.

At launch, the program shows a dialog that asks for the file we want to read,
validating it and passing it to the main form.

On loading the main form, it parses all the data from the file, by reading every
line and creating a `Game` object, which gets saved to an `ICollection<Game>`,
more specifically an `HashSet<Game>` that serves as our "database", and is
displayed fully to the user. We chose an `HashSet<>` together with with
`structs` to prevent duplicate games getting into the *database*;

Then we can filter the *database* using *LINQ*, getting games that match our
criteria or see more detailed info about a specific game we wish.

## Conclusions

With this project we consolidated the medium/advanced C# concepts that were
taught in class by using them in a "real" program. We also learned to use
Windows Forms in order to make an application that could be used more directly
and with a better design than the console/command line.
